Final Year Project - Mechatronics
Vision Based on Vehicle to vehicle Application using Visible Light Communication

Vision System prototype will be developed using Raspberry Pi 3 with the connection of NoIR Camera as an image sensor and LCD as a display output. The proposed project will be programmed using OpenCV, filtered by HSV Algorithm and measured by the distance equation. This prototype will be placed in the back vehicles to detect the tail light of front vehicles and distance estimation will appear in the LCD of the prototype. Data transmission will be applied using the application of On-Off Keying Modulation through the prototype.

Objective : 
1. To develop a vision system prototype by detecting tail light of front vehicles using HSV algorithm to isolate colour intensity.
2. To display the distance between the front and back vehicles through the camera on the raspberry pi LCD.
3. To perform the data transmission from the distance estimation between vehicles using Visible Light Communication.

The receiver module i didnt get to recover due to virus in my external hard disk.
